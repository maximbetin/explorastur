"""
Template for creating new scrapers.

This is a minimal skeleton template that should be copied to a new file
when creating a new scraper. It contains only the essential structure
that needs to be implemented for each scraper.

Usage:
1. Copy this file to a new file with an appropriate name (e.g., new_source.py)
2. Rename the class to match your scraper (e.g., NewSourceScraper)
3. Implement the required methods

Do not modify this template directly - it's meant to be copied.
